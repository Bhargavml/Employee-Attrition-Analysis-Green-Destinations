## Business Problem

Employee attrition leads to increased hiring costs, loss of experience, and reduced productivity. This project answers key questions such as:

* What is the overall attrition rate?
* Which age groups experience the highest attrition?
* How does tenure impact attrition?
* Is attrition higher among lower-income employees?

---

## Key Metrics

* Total Employees: 1,470
* Employees Left: 237
* Overall Attrition Rate: 16.12%

---

## Key Insights

* Employees aged 26–35 show the highest number of exits.
* Attrition is highest during the first 0–2 years of tenure and steadily decreases with experience.
* Lower-income employees have significantly higher attrition compared to medium and high-income groups.
* Longer tenure and higher income correlate with improved retention.
